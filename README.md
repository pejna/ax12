# ax12
Library file for easier use of Dynamixel AX-12, AX-12+ and AX-12A actuators with ATMEGA2561 based controllers.

In the src subfolder is the source for lower level libraries used in ax_12 library. Full ax_12 source with the
accompanying header are included as well. Some things are not commented due to being deemed self explanatory.

Lib file is in Release subfolder. You can also import entire project in your Atmel Studio and compile it yourself.
For use in other projects add ax_12.h to your include folder and add libAX12.a to your libraries, 
all other dependencies should be included automatically.

Any bugs found please notify me or make a merge request.
